I do not understand how to do the skills portion: 
Create a nested for loop that puts a 1 into the cells of all columns A through J, and rows 1 through 10 (e.g., cells A1 - A10, B1 - B10, and so forth).
Modify the nested for loop to fill in a variable number of cells and rows (Hint: use variables).
Modify the nested for loop again to put the sum of the row number and column number into each cell.
Finally, using the same looping mechanism, find a method (through Stack Overflow or another site discussed previously) used to clear the content of the cells you have been editing in the previous step

Tried to make input box work for year entered but I continually get an error. Run-time error '9': Subscript out of range. I am unable to make this work. 

Got it to work. Instructions were not very clear.
